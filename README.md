# Intersect

This set of files is the development of a Hackathon (28 hours) project that took place in St Hyancinthe (Quebec, Canada). 
The aim was to suggest a solution to help Quebec city road users to understand better the system off traffic lights. Indeed the city very is often called about faulty traffic lights when in fact it comes to manual interventions due to operators trying to resolve traffic congestion at peak hours. 

Our multiplatfom web application makes room for an user by allowing this last to signal an intersection where the traffic lights system seem to be defective : when the control center receives an unusual number of plaints about one particular intersection, the operator can focus on this site and resolve the situation whether it is a 

Intersect is therefore no longer a tool for road user, it becomes then a tool for road managers to better detect traffic lights incidents.

As you will be able to si in our files, our method lays on a live geolocation of a user and a simple interface that allows the driver to quicky report an incident. A more accurate comment can be made when the driver is no longer in motion. 

Our project won the first price of 'Concours mordus du transport' organized by AQTR(Association Quebecoise des Transports) in April 2019.
